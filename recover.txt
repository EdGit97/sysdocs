Files are stored on Google Drive and the flash drives in the exact way that the 
files were configured on the hard drive.  To restore from any backup media, 
simply copy the directory from that media to the hard drive using the following 
table:
Accounting -> C:\Accounting
Backup     -> C:\Backup
Documents  -> C:\Users\swane\Documents
Legacy     -> C:\Legacy
Music      -> C:\Users\swane\Music
Pictures   -> C:\Users\swane\Pictures
Src        -> C:\Src
webdevenv  -> C:\webdevenv

Flash drive backups are encrypted by VeraCrypt. The encryption password can
be found on Google Drive at My Drive/Backup/pwds.zip or on the Android phone 
at Simplenote:Passwords.

To access a VeraCrypt partition:
1. Insert the drive into a USB port.
2. C>"C:\Program Files\VeraCrypt\VeraCrypt.exe" /v \Device\Harddisk1\Partition1 /p <mediaPwd> /q /s
3. Open Windows Explorer and note the drive letter that was assigned to the VeraCrypt partition.
4. Files can now be viewed or copied.
5. When finished, unmount the drive: C>"C:\Program Files\VeraCrypt\VeraCrypt.exe" /u /q /s
6. Remove the drive from the USB port.

Once any restore is complete, it will be necessary to recreate Junctions that 
are excluded from the backup:
C:\Src\Legacy\cpm>mklink /j yazemanual C:\Legacy\CPM80\doc_html
C:\Src\sysdocs>mklink /j pzDoc "C:\Program Files\PeaZip\res\share"
C:\webdevenv\utilities\man>mklink /j dg C:\webdevenv\DataGen
