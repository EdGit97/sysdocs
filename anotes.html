			<p class='instructions'>
				The Android System Documentation site was created in order to 
				document the details of the configuration of an Android smart
				phone.  Each page documents a specific area of the system 
				configuration.  
			</p>
			<p class='instructions'>
				The Application page does not use data directly from the 
				application list. The page instead uses offline data that 
				is copied to this site by the generate\adrApps.vbs utility. 
				The reason for this is,	that if the system needs to be rebuilt 
				from scratch, then the generated offline file can be used 
				as a source to rebuild the applicable parts of the system.
			</p>
			<p class='instructions'>
			    The remaining pages consist of static instructions that, when 
				followed, allow the referenced part of the system to be 
				re-installed and reconfigured.
			</p>
			<h2 id='Passwords' name='toc'><img src='images/pwd.png' alt='Password Icon' class='logo'>Passwords</h2>
			<p class='instructions'>
			    Some passwords are kept in Fast Notepad Passwords.  For a 
				complete list, refer to the <a href='notes.html#Passwords'>password list</a> located on the 
				associated Windows system.
