DATA
    ANDROID_BRIDGE = r'C:\Src\CellPhone\platform-tools\adb.exe'
    Final = typing.Final
        Special typing construct to indicate final names to type checkers.

        A final name cannot be re-assigned or overridden in a subclass.

        For example::

            MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
            MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker

            class Connection:
                TIMEOUT: Final[int] = 10

            class FastConnector(Connection):
                TIMEOUT = 1  # Error reported by type checker

        There is no runtime checking of these properties.

    JS_FILE_SPEC = r'C:\Src\sysdocs\include\apps.js'
    JS_VAR_DECL = 'var androidApps = [ '
    NL = '\n'
    __annotations__ = {'ANDROID_BRIDGE': typing.Final[str], 'JS_FILE_SPEC'...
